## Installation

> [!NOTE]
> Python >= 3.10 required

###

```bash
pip install linkedin-api
```

Or, for bleeding edge:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/tomquirk/linkedin-api.git
```

### Quick Start

> [!TIP]
> See all API methods on the [docs](https://linkedin-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html).

The following snippet demonstrates a few basic linkedin_api use cases:

```python
from linkedin_api import Linkedin

# Authenticate using any Linkedin user account credentials
api = Linkedin('reedhoffman@linkedin.com', '*******')

# GET a profile
profile = api.get_profile('billy-g')

# GET a profiles contact info
contact_info = api.get_profile_contact_info('billy-g')

# GET 1st degree connections of a given profile
connections = api.get_profile_connections('1234asc12304')
```

## Development

### Dependencies

- [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)
- A valid Linkedin user account (don't use your personal account, if possible)

### Development installation

1. Create a `.env` config file (use `.env.example` as a reference)
2. Install dependencies using `poetry`:

   ```bash
   poetry install
   poetry self add poetry-plugin-dotenv
   ```

### Run tests

Run all tests:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

Run unit tests:

```bash
poetry run pytest tests/unit
```

Run E2E tests:

```bash
poetry run pytest tests/e2e
```

### Lint

```bash
poetry run black --check .
```

Or to fix:

```bash
poetry run black .
```

### Troubleshooting

#### I keep getting a `CHALLENGE`

Linkedin will throw you a curve ball in the form of a Challenge URL. We currently don't handle this, and so you're kinda screwed. We think it could be only IP-based (i.e. logging in from different location). Your best chance at resolution is to log out and log back in on your browser.

**Known reasons for Challenge** include:

- 2FA
- Rate-limit - "It looks like youâ€™re visiting a very high number of pages on LinkedIn.". Note - n=1 experiment where this page was hit after ~900 contiguous requests in a single session (within the hour) (these included random delays between each request), as well as a bunch of testing, so who knows the actual limit.

Please add more as you come across them.

#### Search problems

- Mileage may vary when searching general keywords like "software" using the standard `search` method. They've recently added some smarts around search whereby they group results by people, company, jobs etc. if the query is general enough. Try to use an entity-specific search method (i.e. search_people) where possible.

## How it works

This project attempts to provide a simple Python interface for the LinkedIn API.

> Do you mean the [legit LinkedIn API](https://developer.linkedin.com/)?

NO! To retrieve structured data, the [LinkedIn Website](https://linkedin.com) uses a service they call **Voyager**. Voyager endpoints give us access to pretty much everything we could want from LinkedIn: profiles, companies, connections, messages, etc. - anything that you can see on linkedin.com, we can get from Voyager.

This project aims to provide complete coverage for Voyager.

[How does it work?](#deep-dive)

### Deep dive

Voyager endpoints look like this:

```text
https://www.linkedin.com/voyager/api/identity/profileView/tom-quirk
```

Or, more clearly

```text
 ___________________________________ _______________________________
|             base path             |            resource           |
https://www.linkedin.com/voyager/api /identity/profileView/tom-quirk
```

They are authenticated with a simple cookie, which we send with every request, along with a bunch of headers.

To get a cookie, we POST a given username and password (of a valid LinkedIn user account) to `https://www.linkedin.com/uas/authenticate`.

### Find new endpoints

We're looking at the LinkedIn website and we spot some data we want. What now?

The following describes the most reliable method to find relevant endpoints:

1. `view source`
1. `command-f`/search the page for some keyword in the data. This will exist inside of a `<code>` tag.
1. Scroll down to the **next adjacent element** which will be another `<code>` tag, probably with an `id` that looks something like

   ```html
   <code style="display: none" id="datalet-bpr-guid-3900675">
     {"request":"/voyager/api/identity/profiles/tom-quirk/profileView","status":200,"body":"bpr-guid-3900675"}
   </code>
   ```

The value of `request` is the url! ðŸ¤˜

You can also use the `network` tab in you browsers developer tools, but you will encounter mixed results.

### How Clients query Voyager

linkedin.com uses the [Rest-li Protocol](https://linkedin.github.io/rest.li/spec/protocol) for querying data. Rest-li is an internal query language/syntax where clients (like linkedin.com) specify what data they want. It's conceptually similar to the GraphQL.

Here's an example of making a request for an organisation's `name` and `groups` (the Linkedin groups it manages):

```text
/voyager/api/organization/companies?decoration=(name,groups*~(entityUrn,largeLogo,groupName,memberCount,websiteUrl,url))&q=universalName&universalName=linkedin
```

The "querying" happens in the `decoration` parameter, which looks like the following:

```text
(
    name,
    groups*~(entityUrn,largeLogo,groupName,memberCount,websiteUrl,url)
)
```

Here, we request an organisation name and a list of groups, where for each group we want `largeLogo`, `groupName`, and so on.

Different endpoints use different parameters (and perhaps even different syntaxes) to specify these queries. Notice that the above query had a parameter `q` whose value was `universalName`; the query was then specified with the `decoration` parameter.

In contrast, the `/search/cluster` endpoint uses `q=guided`, and specifies its query with the `guided` parameter, whose value is something like

```text
List(v->PEOPLE)
```

It could be possible to document (and implement a nice interface for) this query language - as we add more endpoints to this project, I'm sure it will become more clear if such a thing would be possible (and if it's worth it).

### Release a new version

1. Bump `version` in `pyproject.toml`
1. `poetry build`
1. `poetry publish`
1. Draft release notes in GitHub.
